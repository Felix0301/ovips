# Abstract
The OpenVASP Association maintains the **OpenVASP Directory** (*Directory*), a registry of VASPs whose identity and license status has been verified. For each VASP, the *Directory* provides a digitally signed proof of verification called **OpenVASP Credential** (*Credential*).

This OVIP specifies how *Credentials* are structured and how conformant implementations must interpret them.



# Specification

## 1. Retrieving the Credential

Conformant implementations must retrieve the *Credential* directly from the *Directory* smart contract via the `getCredentialRef()` function (see [ovip-0012](https://github.com/OpenVASP/ovips/blob/master/ovip-0012.md)) and must not rely on any other source.

## 2. Credential Integrity

Conformant implementations must verify the *Credential's* content using its hash available from the *Directory* smart contract or the corresponding event logs (see [ovip-0012](https://github.com/OpenVASP/ovips/blob/master/ovip-0012.md)).

## 3. Credential Validity

The *Credential* is valid as long as it can be retrieved from the *Directory*. Revoked *Credentials* remain available from the *Directory's* event logs.

## 4. Credential Content

### 4.1. Credential Structure

The *Credential* is a "Verifiable Credential" as per W3C Recommendation (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) with an element structure as specified in the table below.

| Level 1             | Level 2        | Level 3     | Mult. | Values                                       |

## 5. Presentation Requirements

### 5.1. Credential States

Conformant implementations must present the state of *Credentials* to the user in a clear and obvious way using the mandatory labels in the table specified below.

| Description                                             | Mandatory Label                     |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| Credential is valid                                     | *VASP Verification valid*           |
| Credential was valid in the past, but was since revoked | *VASP Verification no longer valid* |
| Credential's integrity cannot be verified               | *VASP Verification incorrect*       |
| No Credential is available                              | *Unverified VASP*                   |

### 5.2. User Warning

Conformant implementations should interrupt and warn the user when interacting with a VASP whose *Credential* is other than valid.

### 5.3. Credential Details

Conformant implementations must display all *Credential* details to the user on demand.
