## Abstract

The current specification of message protocol is designed to make each message of the session self-sufficient with regards to the details of the transaction. Each time new piece of data is gathered, it migrates to the next logical message. This has some advantages, however there are several reasons to remove all data duplicates, some of the most important being:
* Simplify the messages and define specific notificational function for each of them.
* Simplify development as it is not a good practice to duplicate data in this manner as it could lead to misunderstandings in case data turns out to be different from message to message. It also promotes good style.
* Increase transport layer bandwidth since PoW resources are in direct proportion to the size of the message.

This OVIP is designed to address those issues.

## Specification

### General Description

I propose to remove all data duplicates, meaning that once the piece of data that isn't supposed to be changed during the session is sent and recieved by counterparty, it isn't included in any following messages. For example, once OV (originator VASP) provides the Originator full name and VAAN through the Transfer Request to the BV (beneficiary VASP), they won't be included in Transfer Reply, Transfer Dispatch or Transfer Confirmation messages.
The proposed messages structure is described in the following paragraph (leaving Session Request and Session Reply as they are).

### Proposed messages structure

Please note that Signature is deliberately removed from the tables as it is not a part of the protocol messages.

#### Public Key Format

The Secp256k1 public keys usage remains as specified in the original Whitepaper. However the Whitepaper does not specify the exact format. The public keys must be send in [compressed](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/guide/public-key) form. That is it must be represented with exactly 33 bytes (66 characters) and is prefixed with '02' or '03'.

## Motivation

Simplicity - simplify the messages and define specific notificational function for each of them.
Design - it is not a good practice to duplicate data in this manner as it could lead to misunderstandings in case data turns out to be different from message to message.
Efficienty - reduced message size means reduced PoW resources.

## Rationale

This is a simple and a straightforward solution that fixes all listed issues.
